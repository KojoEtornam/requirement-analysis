                                                              Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, analyzed, and documented to establish a clear understanding of what the software system must achieve. This process involves interaction with stakeholders such as clients, users, managers, and technical staff to ensure that all requirements are clearly understood and feasible.
                                        Objectives of Requirement Analysis
Identify the purpose and goals of the software.
Determine functional and non-functional requirements.
Resolve ambiguities, conflicts, and incomplete information.
Establish a baseline for project planning and development.
                                    Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC
Foundation for All Subsequent Phases:
Accurate requirements guide design, development, testing, and deployment.
Prevents Project Failures:
Most software project failures stem from poor requirements or misunderstood needs.
Saves Time and Cost:
Catching errors early in the requirement phase is far less expensive than fixing them later in development or post-deployment.
Improves Communication:
A well-documented set of requirements serves as a communication bridge between stakeholders and developers.
Ensures User Satisfaction:
Capturing true user needs leads to a product that meets or exceeds expectations.
Facilitates Testing and Validation:
Well-defined requirements serve as the basis for test case development and system validation.
